# BiDoluApp


I created a food application with VIPER architecture in my last homework in Swift Bootcamp.In this application, I applied the process of adding sign in and sign up with Firebase, deleting, sorting by price, a button that allows the application to select food for users who cannot decide what they want to eat, search and collective deletion.

- VIPER Architecture
- Firebase Auth
- Alamofire
